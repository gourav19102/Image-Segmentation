# Image-Segmentation
This repository offers a comparison study of three image segmentation models: UNET, LINKNET, and UNET++. The image segmentation use case here will be the kaggle-hosted severstal steel defect detection problem.

## Dataset: [Severstal: Steel Defect Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/severstal-steel-defect-detection/data)

### Problem Statement: the objective of this project is to predict the location and type of deffect found in steel manufacturing using the images provided. for more details you can visit : [Severstal steel](https://www.kaggle.com/c/severstal-steel-defect-detection)
